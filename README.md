PostsApp

A modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project serves as a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

üöÄ Features

React: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

Vite: A next-generation, fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development environment.

ESLint: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

React: For building the user interface.

TypeScript: For type safety and better developer experience.

Vite: For fast and optimized build process.

ESLint: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
